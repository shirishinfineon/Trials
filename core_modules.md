# Core System Modules for Algo Trading System

This document outlines the core modules for the algorithmic trading system. Each module has a specific set of responsibilities to ensure a cohesive and functional system.

## Modules

1.  **Data Handler:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Responsible for sourcing, ingesting, cleaning, and managing market data (historical and real-time) from various sources. It provides a consistent API for other modules to access this data. This includes handling data formats, managing data storage, and providing data on demand.

2.  **Strategy Engine:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Implements the trading strategies. It receives market data from the Data Handler, processes it according to the defined strategy logic, and generates trading signals (e.g., buy, sell, hold). It can host multiple strategies and manage their lifecycle.

3.  **Execution Engine:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Takes trading signals from the Strategy Engine and translates them into actual orders to be sent to the broker. It manages order lifecycle (e.g., placing, modifying, canceling orders), handles order execution feedback, and aims for optimal execution (e.g., minimizing slippage).

4.  **Portfolio Manager:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Tracks the current state of the trading portfolio, including positions, cash balance, and overall portfolio value. It updates portfolio metrics based on executed trades and market data. It provides a real-time view of portfolio performance and risk.

5.  **Risk Manager:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Monitors and manages the risk exposure of the portfolio. This includes (for now, basic) pre-trade risk checks (e.g., position sizing limits, maximum loss per trade) and post-trade risk monitoring (e.g., overall portfolio drawdown limits). It can generate alerts or intervene if risk thresholds are breached.

6.  **Configuration Manager:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages system-wide and strategy-specific configurations. This includes parameters for strategies, connection details for brokers, risk limits, and other operational settings. It allows for easy modification and reloading of configurations without system restarts.

7.  **Trade Logger:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Records all trading activities, including signals generated, orders placed, executions received, and errors encountered. This provides an audit trail for debugging, performance analysis, and regulatory compliance.

8.  **Reporting Engine:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Generates reports on trading performance, risk exposure, and system health. This can include metrics like P&L, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, trade statistics, etc. Reports can be scheduled or generated on demand.

9.  **Broker Interface (Abstract):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Provides an abstract interface for interacting with different brokers. The Execution Engine uses this interface to send orders and receive execution updates, decoupling the core system from specific broker APIs. Concrete implementations will exist for each supported broker.

10. **Main Application Orchestrator (e.g., Backtester Engine / Live Trading Engine):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Coordinates the overall operation of the system. In a backtesting scenario, it would simulate trading by feeding historical data through the system. In live trading, it would manage the real-time flow of data and operations. It initializes and connects all other modules, manages the event loop, and handles system startup and shutdown.
